I have analyzed datasets related to electric vehicles (EVs),
focusing on uncovering meaningful insights and providing
actionable recommendations. I filtered EVs based on budget and
range criteria, grouped them by manufacturer, and calculated
average battery capacities. To identify patterns, I visualized the
relationship between battery capacity and range and detected
outliers in energy consumption. Additionally, I developed an EV
recommendation system in Python that allows users to input their
budget, desired range, and battery capacity to find the best
matches. Using hypothesis testing, I compared the engine power
of Tesla and Audi vehicles, drawing insights that informed
strategic recommendations.
